Hello! I’m a Cybersecurity graduate with a passion for exploring and experimenting across different areas of the field. On this blog, I’ll be sharing my experiences with homelabs, CTF challenges, and the insights I gain along the way.

While I’m currently focusing on developing my skills in Security Operations (SOC), my ultimate goal is to delve deeper into penetration testing. Expect this space to cover multiple aspects of cybersecurity as I grow and learn.
