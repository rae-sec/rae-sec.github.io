Hello and Welcome!

This is my little corner of the web where I share what I’m exploring in cybersecurity, homelabs, and penetration testing.

I built the site using Jekyll and host it on GitHub Pages, so it’s fast, simple, and easy for me to update whenever I have something new to share. Here, you’ll find tutorials, lab experiments, and insights from my journey into different sides of tech and security.

I hope you enjoy following along as I experiment, learn, and dive deeper into the world of cybersecurity.
